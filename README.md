Galvanize Capstone Project: Demystifying trends and tracking topics across verticals.

## Motivation
![Alt text](https://github.com/rawanhassunah/trendster/master/images/categories.png)

Since news is structured in a rigid categorical format, it may be difficult to follow a topic of interest in one snapshot. Generally, if one is interested in a topic, it tends to not exhibit this type of compartmentalization, and is actually more fluid in nature, sitting at the intersection of these categorical verticals. My idea was to create a set of tools and visualizations to help track the evolution of a topic of interest in the media over time.

## Pipeline
### Filtering

### Topic Modeling

## Key Takeaways
### Relevant and time dependent categories.

### Meaningful nuances between topics.
